double getAverage(int arr[], int size);
int main () {
int balance[5] = {1000, 2, 3, 17, 50};
double avg;
avg = getAverage( balance[0], 5 ) ;
cout << "Average value is: " << avg << endl;
return 0;
}

Ans: 

    There are two errors

    1) While calling the function getAverage : we are passing an int type whereas in the function declaration
        It is expecting the reference or the int* type.
    2) The function is not completely what it has to do, so even after fixing the first error the code will now
        have the error saying undefined reference.
